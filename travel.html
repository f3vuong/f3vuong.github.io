                Iceland is a country full of tourist from all around the world. It is a safe and beautiful country full of mindblowing views. We decided to rent a campervan to drive on one of the most popular routes, this route is known as the Ring Road. Iceland is known as the land of fire and ice because it is home to both volcanos and glaciers. If you want to see it all, Ring Road is the route to go. It takes you around the whole country and can be finished in a weeks time.

                    I should tell you that when driving around the country, you won't find a lot of civilization, but I believe that was the beauty of the trip. As we were half way across the country, we started hearing strange sounds while driving. We quickly found a safe spot to stop and inspect the campervan. We must have driven on something sharp because one of our tires was completely torn apart. As I mentioned earlier, there was no civilization in sight. Two girls, one broken tire in the middle of nowhere. Not long after we stopped, luckily, from a distance we started seeing a car approaching our direction. We waved them down. It was a middle-aged Austrian couple. Maybe we were in shock earlier, but for some reason we did not think about looking for a spare tire until they reminded us. The Austrian couple was nice enough to stay with us and guide us on what we should do, but we couldn't find the spare tire. They gave us a number to call and wished us luck before they left. We continued looking everywhere and found the tire hidden under the mattress. We quickly pulled it out, but there was one problem... we both never changed a tire before.

                    I've always learned that in a fairytale, a man riding a horse will come save me. That is exactly what happened. From a distance we heard the galloping of a horse, we turn to see an Icelandic man riding his horse and while walking his dog. I've never been happier in my life, I immediately greeted him hoping he could help us. Being the chatter box I am, I didn't realize this Icelandic man doesn't understand English. It became a game of charades, but thankfully it wasn't hard to realize our tire was completely torn apart. He didn't say a word, handed us his horse, made a phone call and changed our tire. We are so thankful for him till this day.

                    Iceland was beautiful and there was so much more to the trip. Although at the time, this situation was scary and stressful, it gave us and opportunity to interact with other people around the world. It also taught us very important life lessons. Always check for the spare tire before leaving with a rental car, don't be afraid to ask for help and being able to change a tire is an important life skill. Of course that was the first thing I learned to do when I got home.
